# 01-Challenge

## Description

The 01-Challenge project involved refactoring starter code for the marketing agency, Horiseon, to increase web acccessibility on their existing site.

The existing code for the website was refactored to improve element structure, include semantic HTML elements, and consolidate properties and selectors within CSS.

Alternative text was added to all images and icons found on the website.

While the title attribute provides a description while the user hovers over an image, the alt attribute is accessible to screen readers. Therefore, the alt attribute was used to include image and icon descriptions.

## Mock Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
